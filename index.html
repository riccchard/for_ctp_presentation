			<h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
			<p> I love listening music, especially, when i use public transportation. If I'm in wifi-zone or have a lot of LTE data, there are so many things to do with my iPhone. However, without internet I just listen to music, and sometimes it's boring. I want to do something cool with my favorite musics. This project starts at this point. </p>

			<h2> 2. Component </h2>
				<h3 style="margin:0px"><ul style="margin:0px">
					<li> File uploader </li>
				</ul></h3>
				<p> Here you upload your music or video. After uploading, MCRM will automatically detect bpm of your file. </p>
				<br>

				<h3 style="margin:0px"><ul style="margin:0px">
					<li> Count number </li>
				</ul></h3>
				<p> You can modify count number. This number is needed when MCRM change filter. If count number is 8, MCRM will reselect a filter every 8th beat. After change number, you should click 'Count Rest' button. </p>
				<br>

				<h3 style="margin:0px"><ul style="margin:0px">
					<li> Kick Threshold </li>
				</ul></h3>
				<p> MCRM detect kick sound with amplitude of 88Hz frequency band. If kick threshold is -25dB, MCRM will recognize kick sound when 88Hz frequency band has more than -25dB. You can adjust this value to suit your music. </p>
				<br>

				<h3 style="margin:0px"><ul style="margin:0px">
					<li> Visualizer </li>
				</ul></h3>
				<p> Visualizer has 8 frequency bands. Starting at bottom-left, frequency increases in clock-wise. This visualizer has user interaction. If you click anywhere in visualizer boundary, audio will get peaking filter. Thus, you can boost bass or vocal with your mouse click and drag. </p>
				<br>

				<h3 style="margin:0px"><ul style="margin:0px">
					<li> Camera / Video </li>
				</ul></h3>
				<p> Basically it uses your web-cam and shows the screen. In case you upload video, it will show you the video. </p>
				<br>

				<h3 style="margin:0px"><ul style="margin:0px">
					<li> Filters </li>
				</ul></h3>
				<p> There are several filters, so we can apply them to our camera or video. If you choose more than one filter, MCRM randomly choose one of your choices. </p>
				<br>

			<h2> Improvement point </h2>
				<h3 style="margin:0px"><ul style="margin:0px">
					<li> Sound detection </li>
				</ul></h3>
				<p> This machine can detect only kick sound. Moreover, it's not clearly working with kind of messy music. I want to upgrade this part, so this program can recognize various instruments with robust algorithm. </p>
				<br>

				<h3 style="margin:0px"><ul style="margin:0px">
					<li> Working on smartphone </li>
				</ul></h3>
				<p> This is web version of my first idea. My final goal is make this machine work on smartphone, so I can play it anywhere, anytime. </p>
				<br>

				<h3 style="margin:0px"><ul style="margin:0px">
					<li> SNOW filter </li>
				</ul></h3>
				<p> Filter is not enough yet. There are lots of camera filters in the world. If we can use 'Snow filter', it will be much more interesting. </p>
				<br>

				<h3 style="margin:0px"><ul style="margin:0px">
					<li> Vine </li>
				</ul></h3>
				<p> Vine has comfortable recording system. We can upload funny, filtered videos using Vine and MCRM </p>
